Self-hosted runners offer more control of hardware, operating system, and software tools than GitHub-hosted runners provide. 
With self-hosted runners, you can create custom hardware configurations that meet your needs with processing power or memory to run larger jobs,
install software available on your local network, and choose an operating system not offered by GitHub-hosted runners.
Self-hosted runners can be physical, virtual, in a container, on-premises, or in a cloud.

You can add self-hosted runners at various levels in the management hierarchy:

    Repository-level runners are dedicated to a single repository.
    Organization-level runners can process jobs for multiple repositories in an organization.
    Enterprise-level runners can be assigned to multiple organizations in an enterprise account.


Your runner machine connects to GitHub using the GitHub Actions self-hosted runner application. The GitHub Actions runner application is open source.
You can contribute and file issues in the runner repository. 
When a new version is released, the runner application automatically updates itself when a job is assigned to the runner,
or within a week of release if the runner hasn't been assigned any jobs.

A self-hosted runner is automatically removed from GitHub if it has not connected to GitHub Actions for more than 14 days.
An ephemeral self-hosted runner is automatically removed from GitHub if it has not connected to GitHub Actions for more than 1 day.
